    <h1 class="aboutmetitle">Skin Lab has finally arrived...sort of</h1>
    <p>10.27.2017</p>
    <p>Since around a year ago, I have been itching (pun intended) to build an informational website that teaches people about
      the ingredients used in skincare products and their pros &amp; cons. I believe what we apply on our skin is as important
      as what we put in our stomach - if we know how to read food labels and nutrition facts, we should also learn to be
      aware of what the active ingredients are in our facial cleanser or night cream. Here comes Skin Lab, a quick-and-easy
      starting point to help you learn about the chemical composition in various skincare products and their impact on your
      skin. I also plan to add a feature in the future where Skin Lab can make product and skincare routine recommendations
      utilizing machine learning mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Check out a rough prototype that I just finished building at
      <a href="http://skincare.allisonzhao.com">skincare.allisonzhao.com</a> and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or advices. All suggestions welcomed!
    </p>
    <p>P.S. This project is built solely in React without a database or ORM, so only a few sections of the site are populated
      with information at the moment (for demonstration purposes). More to come! :) </p>
