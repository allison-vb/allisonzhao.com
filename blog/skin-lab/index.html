    <h1 class="aboutmetitle">Skin Lab has finally arrived...sort of</h1>
    <p>10.27.2017</p>
    <p>Since around a year ago, I have been itching (pun intended) to build an informational website that teaches people about
      the ingredients used in skincare products and their pros &amp; cons. In fact, what we put on our skin is just as important
      as what we put in our stomach. Most of us know how to read food labels and nutrition facts, but how many of us are
      aware of what the active ingredients are in our facial cleanser or night cream? Here comes Skin Lab, a quick-and-easy
      starting point to help you learn about the chemical composition in various skincare products and their impact on your
      skin. Based on your skin type and skincare concerns, Skin Lab can also make product and skincare routine recommendations
      for you.</p>
    <p>Check out a rough prototype that I just finished building at skincare.allisonzhao.com and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or advices. All suggestions welcomed!
    </p>
    <p>P.S. This project is built solely in React without a database or ORM, hence only certain sections of the site are populated with
      information at the moment for demonstration purposes. More to come! :) </p>
