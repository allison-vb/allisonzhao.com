    <h1 class="aboutmetitle">Skin Lab has finally arrived...sort of</h1>
    <p>10.27.2017</p>
    <p>Since around a year ago, I have been itching (pun intended) to build an educational website that teaches people
      about
      the ingredients used in skincare products and their pros &amp; cons. I believe what we apply on our skin is as
      important
      as what we put in our stomach; we should not only understand the nutrition facts labels, but also the active
      ingredients in our daily cleanser or sunscreen. Skin Lab serves as a quick-and-easy
      starting point to help you learn about the chemical composition in various skincare products and their impact on
      your
      skin. I also plan to incoporate machine learning mechanisms in the future where Skin Lab can make product and
      skincare routine
      recommendations.</p>
    <p>Check out a rough prototype that I just finished building at
      <a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://skincare.allisonzhao.com">skincare.allisonzhao.com</a> and feel free to
      contact me if you have any
      questions or advices. All suggestions welcomed!
    </p>
    <p>P.S. This project is built solely in React without a database or ORM, so only a few sections of the site are
      populated
      with data at the moment (for demonstration purposes). More to come! :) </p>
