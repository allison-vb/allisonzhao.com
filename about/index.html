        <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
        <p>I have a degree in Music Business, but fell in love with programming during my last year in college. In the past
            few years, I have worked at all three major record labels, Nielsen and Condé Nast. I am now a fullstack software developer.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">OPENING SONATA</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Shenzhen (check
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY" class=video target="_blank">this</a> video out), I moved to New York in 2012 for college. Having a strong passion in music and knowing how
            difficult it is to make a decent living as a musician, I majored in Music Business and fought my way into the
            “The Big Three”: Warner, Sony and Universal. Fun work, no dress code, free CDs and vinyl records, occasional
            artist performances in the office. Had a blast.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">ADAGIO</h2>
        <p>During my last year at NYU, I interned at Nielsen and had my ‘love at first sight’ moment. Not necessarily the best
            kind - I was writing basic HTML and tweaking CSS templates for newsletters. Nevertheless, a door to a new world
            was opened: a world full of logical operators and frustration in text alignment. I immediately declared a minor
            in Web Programming and Applications afterwards, learned Python, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Processing and MongoDB
            (really need a refresher on this one) and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that learning how to program really
            satisfied my curious mind and more importantly, gave me a sense of purpose.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">MINUET AND TRIO</h2>
        <p>Right after graduation, I landed a job at Condé Nast in the beautiful 1 World Trade Center office as an Ad Ops Specialist.
            Working in Ad Ops was similar to building a bridge between engineering and sales - the two teams speak very different
            languages and I had to learn to be well-versed in both. Through living in the browser console 24/7, I realized
            that I truly enjoyed learning about how web development works under the hood, and decided to pursue software engineering full-time.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">ALLEGRO</h2>
        <p>Here I am, ready to code more, learn more and experience more (hopefully workout more but who am I kidding). Nobody
            says a four-year CS education is required to start a career in engineering.
            <br> It takes gumption, a lot of it.</p>
