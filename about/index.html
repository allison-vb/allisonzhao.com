        <h1 class="aboutmetitle">About Me</h1>
        <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
        <p>I have a degree in Music Business, but fell in love with programming during my last year in college. In the past
            few years, I have worked at all three major labels, Nielsen and Condé Nast. I have recently quit my job
            to pursue a career in software development.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">OPENING SONATA</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Shenzhen (check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY" class=video target="_blank">this</a>            video out), I moved to New York in 2012 for college. Having a strong passion in music and knowing how difficult
            it is to make a decent living as a musician, I majored in Music Business and fought my way into the “The Big
            Three”: Warner, Sony and Universal. Fun work, no dress code, free CDs and vinyl records, occasional artist performances.
            Had a blast.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">ADAGIO</h2>
        <p>During my last year at NYU, I interned at Nielsen and had my ‘love at first sight’ moment. Not necessarily the best
            kind - I was writing basic HTML and tweaking CSS templates for newsletters. Nevertheless, a door to a new world was opened:
            a world full of logical operators and frustration in text alignment. I immediately declared a minor in Web Programming
            and Applications afterwards, learned Python, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Processing and MongoDB (really need a refresher on this
            one) and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that learning how to program really satisfied my curious mind and
            more importantly, gave me a sense of purpose.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">MINUET AND TRIO</h2>
        <p>Right after graduation, I landed a job at Condé Nast in the beautiful 1 World Trade Center office as an Ad Ops Specialist.
            Being in Ad Ops was similar to being a bridge between engineering and sales - the two teams speak very different
            languages and I had to learn to be well-versed in both. I was living in the browser console 24/7, implementing
            customized code for rich media units (a term for fancy ads), and making sure the sales team have full ad tech
            support(and explaining to them how web pages work, at times.#adopsjoke). At this job, I realized that I truly
            enjoyed working with the engineering team, QA-ing code and fixing websites, and was not really interested in
            the sales side of the business. I was ready and simply couldn’t wait to dive into the world of software development.</p>
        <h2 class="subheader">ALLEGRO</h2>
        <p>Here I am, ready to code more, workout more (who am I kidding) and explore more. Nobody says a four-year
            CS education is required to start a career in engineering. <br> <b>It takes gumption, a lot of it.</b></p>
